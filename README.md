# Aeolian-sediment-transport-in-supply-limited-situations
These files contains the Matlab code used to generate the results in the paper by De Vries et. al. 2014 ['Aeolian sediment transport in supply limited situations'](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aeolia.2013.11.005). 

Development of these procedures is continued within the AeoLiS model. AeoLiS is a process-based model for simulating aeolian sediment transport in situations where supply-limiting factors are important, like in coastal environments. Supply-limitations currently supported are moisture content, sediment sorting and armouring and bed slope effects. The AeoLiS model can be found at (https://github.com/openearth/aeolis/).
